# NLP Sentiment Analysis Projects Repository
  Welcome to the NLP Sentiment Analysis Projects Repository! This repository contains three sentiment analysis projects utilizing different methods for sentiment classification: Bag-of-Words with Sparse Matrix, Positive-Negative Word Frequency Analysis, and Naive Bayes Classifier.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Bag-of-Words with Sparse Matrix Method

 - **Description**: This project implements sentiment analysis using the Bag-of-Words (BoW) model and optimizing it with sparse matrix techniques for efficiency.
 - **Directory**: BOW_Sparse_Method/
 - **Dependencies**: Python, NumPy, Scikit-learn
### 2.Positive-Negative Word Frequency Analysis Method

- **Description**: This project focuses on sentiment analysis by analyzing the frequency of positive and negative words in the text to determine sentiment.
- **Directory**: Pos_Neg_Frequency_Method/
- **Dependencies**: Python, NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- 
### 3.Naive Bayes Classifier Method

- **Description**: This project utilizes the Naive Bayes classifier for sentiment analysis, which is a probabilistic model based on Bayes' theorem.
- **Directory**: Naive_Bayes_Method/
- **Dependencies**: Python, Scikit-learn, NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
